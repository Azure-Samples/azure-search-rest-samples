#  Indexing encrypted Blob files in Azure AI Search using REST APIs and Postman

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection uses the Azure AI Search REST APIs to create the resources necessary to be able to index files that have been encrypted in Azure Blob Storage: a data source, an index, a skillset with select skills, and an indexer with a specific configuration. Requests are provided in the V2 collection format, which you can import and then modify for connections to your search service.

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how, if you have an existing Azure Storage account with encrypted blobs, you can successfully index them into Azure AI Search.
